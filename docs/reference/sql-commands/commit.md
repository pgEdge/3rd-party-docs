# COMMIT

commit the current transaction

## Synopsis


```

COMMIT [ WORK | TRANSACTION ] [ AND [ NO ] CHAIN ]
```


## Description


 `COMMIT` commits the current transaction. All changes made by the transaction become visible to others and are guaranteed to be durable if a crash occurs.


 If the transaction is in an aborted state then no changes will be made and the effect of the `COMMIT` will be identical to that of `ROLLBACK`, including the command tag output.


 In either case, if the `AND CHAIN` parameter is specified then a new, identically configured, transaction is started.


 For more information regarding transactions see [Transactions](../../tutorial/advanced-features/transactions.md#tutorial-transactions).


## Parameters


<a id="sql-commit-transaction"></a>

`WORK`, `TRANSACTION`
:   Optional key words. They have no effect.
<a id="sql-commit-chain"></a>

`AND CHAIN`
:   If `AND CHAIN` is specified, a new transaction is immediately started with the same transaction characteristics (see [sql-set-transaction](set-transaction.md#sql-set-transaction)) as the just finished one. Otherwise, no new transaction is started.


## Outputs


 On successful completion of a non-aborted transaction, a `COMMIT` command returns a command tag of the form

```

COMMIT
```


 However, in an aborted transaction, a `COMMIT` command returns a command tag of the form

```

ROLLBACK
```


## Notes


 Use [sql-rollback](rollback.md#sql-rollback) to abort a transaction.


 Issuing `COMMIT` when not inside a transaction does no harm, but it will provoke a warning message. `COMMIT AND CHAIN` when not inside a transaction is an error.


## Examples


 To commit the current transaction and make all changes permanent:

```sql

COMMIT;
```


## Compatibility


 The command `COMMIT` conforms to the SQL standard, except that no exception condition is raised in the case where the transaction was already aborted.


 The form `COMMIT TRANSACTION` is a PostgreSQL extension.
