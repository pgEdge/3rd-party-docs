# CREATE SCHEMA

define a new schema

## Synopsis


```

CREATE SCHEMA SCHEMA_NAME [ AUTHORIZATION ROLE_SPECIFICATION ] [ SCHEMA_ELEMENT [ ... ] ]
CREATE SCHEMA AUTHORIZATION ROLE_SPECIFICATION [ SCHEMA_ELEMENT [ ... ] ]
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS SCHEMA_NAME [ AUTHORIZATION ROLE_SPECIFICATION ]
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS AUTHORIZATION ROLE_SPECIFICATION

where ROLE_SPECIFICATION can be:

    USER_NAME
  | CURRENT_ROLE
  | CURRENT_USER
  | SESSION_USER
```


## Description


 `CREATE SCHEMA` enters a new schema into the current database. The schema name must be distinct from the name of any existing schema in the current database.


 A schema is essentially a namespace: it contains named objects (tables, data types, functions, and operators) whose names can duplicate those of other objects existing in other schemas. Named objects are accessed either by “qualifying” their names with the schema name as a prefix, or by setting a search path that includes the desired schema(s). A `CREATE` command specifying an unqualified object name creates the object in the current schema (the one at the front of the search path, which can be determined with the function `current_schema`).


 Optionally, `CREATE SCHEMA` can include subcommands to create objects within the new schema. The subcommands are treated essentially the same as separate commands issued after creating the schema, except that if the `AUTHORIZATION` clause is used, all the created objects will be owned by that user.


## Parameters


*schema_name*
:   The name of a schema to be created. If this is omitted, the *user_name* is used as the schema name. The name cannot begin with `pg_`, as such names are reserved for system schemas.

*user_name*
:   The role name of the user who will own the new schema. If omitted, defaults to the user executing the command. To create a schema owned by another role, you must be able to `SET ROLE` to that role.

*schema_element*
:   An SQL statement defining an object to be created within the schema. Currently, only `CREATE AGGREGATE`, `CREATE COLLATION`, `CREATE DOMAIN`, `CREATE FUNCTION`, `CREATE INDEX`, `CREATE OPERATOR`, `CREATE PROCEDURE`, `CREATE SEQUENCE`, `CREATE TABLE`, `CREATE TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION`, `CREATE TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY`, `CREATE TEXT SEARCH PARSER`, `CREATE TEXT SEARCH TEMPLATE`, `CREATE TRIGGER`, `CREATE TYPE`, `CREATE VIEW`, and `GRANT` are accepted as clauses within `CREATE SCHEMA`. Other kinds of objects may be created within the schema in separate commands after the schema is created.

`IF NOT EXISTS`
:   Do nothing (except issuing a notice) if a schema with the same name already exists. *schema_element* subcommands cannot be included when this option is used.


## Notes


 To create a schema, the invoking user must have the `CREATE` privilege for the current database. (Of course, superusers bypass this check.)


 The *schema_element* subcommands, if any, are executed in the order they are written. An exception is that foreign key constraint clauses in `CREATE TABLE` subcommands are postponed and added at the end. This allows circular foreign key references, which are sometimes useful.


## Examples


 Create a schema:

```sql

CREATE SCHEMA myschema;
```


 Create a schema for user `joe`; the schema will also be named `joe`:

```sql

CREATE SCHEMA AUTHORIZATION joe;
```


 Create a schema named `test` that will be owned by user `joe`, unless there already is a schema named `test`. (It does not matter whether `joe` owns the pre-existing schema.)

```sql

CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS test AUTHORIZATION joe;
```


 Create a schema and create a table and view within it:

```sql

CREATE SCHEMA hollywood
    CREATE TABLE films (title text, release date, awards text[])
    CREATE VIEW winners AS
        SELECT title, release FROM films WHERE awards IS NOT NULL;
```
 Notice that the individual subcommands do not end with semicolons.


 The following is an equivalent way of accomplishing the same result:

```sql

CREATE SCHEMA hollywood;
CREATE TABLE hollywood.films (title text, release date, awards text[]);
CREATE VIEW hollywood.winners AS
    SELECT title, release FROM hollywood.films WHERE awards IS NOT NULL;
```


## Compatibility


 The SQL standard allows a `DEFAULT CHARACTER SET` clause in `CREATE SCHEMA`, as well as more subcommand types than are presently accepted by PostgreSQL.


 Some other SQL implementations attempt to allow more kinds of forward references to objects defined in later *schema_element* subcommands than just foreign key constraints. This is difficult or impossible to do correctly in general, and it is not clear that the SQL standard requires any such behavior except for foreign keys.


 According to the SQL standard, the owner of a schema always owns all objects within it. PostgreSQL allows schemas to contain objects owned by users other than the schema owner. This can happen only if the schema owner grants the `CREATE` privilege on their schema to someone else, or a superuser chooses to create objects in it.


 The `IF NOT EXISTS` option is a PostgreSQL extension.
