## pg_stash_advice — store and automatically apply plan advice


 The `pg_stash_advice` extension allows you to stash [plan advice](pg_plan_advice-help-the-planner-get-the-right-plan.md#pgplanadvice) strings in dynamic shared memory where they can be automatically applied. An `advice stash` is a mapping from [query identifiers](../../server-administration/server-configuration/run-time-statistics.md#guc-compute-query-id) to plan advice strings. Whenever a session is asked to plan a query whose query ID appears in the relevant advice stash, the plan advice string is automatically applied to guide planning. Note that advice stashes are stored in dynamically allocated shared memory. This means that it is important to be mindful of memory consumption when deciding how much plan advice to stash. Optionally, advice stashes and their contents can automatically be persisted to disk and reloaded from disk; see `pg_stash_advice.persist`, below.


 In order to use this module, you will need to execute `CREATE EXTENSION pg_stash_advice` in at least one database, so that you have access to the SQL functions to manage advice stashes. You will also need the `pg_stash_advice` module to be loaded in all sessions where you want this module to automatically apply advice. It will usually be best to do this by adding `pg_stash_advice` to [shared_preload_libraries](../../server-administration/server-configuration/client-connection-defaults.md#guc-shared-preload-libraries) and restarting the server.


 Once you have met the above criteria, you can create advice stashes using the `pg_create_advice_stash` function described below and set the plan advice for a given query ID in a given stash using the `pg_set_stashed_advice` function. Then, you need only configure `pg_stash_advice.stash_name` to point to the chosen advice stash name. For some use cases, rather than setting this on a system-wide basis, you may find it helpful to use `ALTER DATABASE ... SET` or `ALTER ROLE ... SET` to configure values that will apply only to a database or only to a certain role. Likewise, it may sometimes be better to set the stash name in a particular session using `SET`.


 Because `pg_stash_advice` works on the basis of query identifiers, you will need to determine the query identifier for each query whose plan you wish to control. You will also need to determine the advice string that you wish to store for each query. One way to do this is to use `EXPLAIN`: the `VERBOSE` option will show the query ID, and the `PLAN_ADVICE` option will show plan advice. Query identifiers can also be obtained through tools such as [pg_stat_statements](pg_stat_statements-track-statistics-of-sql-planning-and-execution.md#pgstatstatements) or [`pg_stat_activity`](../../server-administration/monitoring-database-activity/the-cumulative-statistics-system.md#monitoring-pg-stat-activity-view), but these tools will not provide plan advice strings. Note that [compute_query_id](../../server-administration/server-configuration/run-time-statistics.md#guc-compute-query-id) must be enabled for query identifiers to be computed; if set to `auto`, loading `pg_stash_advice` will enable it automatically.


 Generally, the fact that the planner is able to change query plans as the underlying distribution of data changes is a feature, not a bug. Moreover, applying plan advice can have a noticeable performance cost even when it does not result in a change to the query plan. Therefore, it is a good idea to use this feature only when and to the extent needed. Plan advice strings can be trimmed down to mention only those aspects of the plan that need to be controlled, and used only for queries where there is believed to be a significant risk of planner error.


 Note that `pg_stash_advice` currently lacks a sophisticated security model. Only the superuser, or a user to whom the superuser has granted `EXECUTE` permission on the relevant functions, may create advice stashes or alter their contents, but any user may set `pg_stash_advice.stash_name` for their session, and this may reveal the contents of any advice stash with that name. Users should assume that information embedded in stashed advice strings may become visible to non-privileged users.

### Functions


`pg_create_advice_stash(stash_name text) returns void`
:   Creates a new, empty advice stash with the given name.

`pg_drop_advice_stash(stash_name text) returns void`
:   Drops the named advice stash and all of its entries.

`pg_set_stashed_advice(stash_name text, query_id bigint, advice_string text) returns void`
:   Stores an advice string in the named advice stash, associated with the given query identifier. If an entry for that query identifier already exists in the stash, it is replaced. If `advice_string` is `NULL`, any existing entry for that query identifier is removed.

`pg_get_advice_stashes() returns setof (stash_name text, num_entries bigint)`
:   Returns one row for each advice stash, showing the stash name and the number of entries it contains.

`pg_get_advice_stash_contents(stash_name text) returns setof (stash_name text, query_id bigint, advice_string text)`
:   Returns one row for each entry in the named advice stash. If `stash_name` is `NULL`, returns entries from all stashes.

`pg_start_stash_advice_worker() returns void`
:   Starts the background worker, so that advice stash contents can be automatically persisted to disk. If this module is included in [shared_preload_libraries](../../server-administration/server-configuration/client-connection-defaults.md#guc-shared-preload-libraries) at startup time with `pg_stash_advice.persist = true`, the worker will be started automatically. When started manually, the worker will not load anything from disk, but it will still persist data to disk. You can then configure the server to start the worker automatically after the next restart, preserving any stashed advice you add now.

### Configuration Parameters


`pg_stash_advice.persist` (`boolean`)
:   Controls whether the advice stashes and stash entries should be persisted to disk. This is on by default. If any stashes are persisted, a file named `pg_stash_advice.tsv` will be created in the data directory. Stashes are loaded and saved using a background worker process. This parameter can only be set at server start.

`pg_stash_advice.persist_interval` (`integer`)
:   Specifies the interval, in seconds, between checks for changes that need to be written to `pg_stash_advice.tsv`. If set to zero, changes are only written when the server shuts down. The default value is `30`. This parameter can only be set in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line.

`pg_stash_advice.stash_name` (`string`)
:   Specifies the name of the advice stash to consult during query planning. The default value is the empty string, which disables this module.
