# Binary Vectors

Use the `bit` type to store binary vectors ([example](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector-python/blob/master/examples/imagehash/example.py))

```sql
CREATE TABLE items (id bigserial PRIMARY KEY, embedding bit(3));
INSERT INTO items (embedding) VALUES ('000'), ('111');
```

Get the nearest neighbors by Hamming distance

```sql
SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <~> '101' LIMIT 5;
```

Also supports Jaccard distance (`<%>`)
